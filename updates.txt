Day 1: 1/9/2025
What did I do?
Read through w3 schools on HTML, CSS, and JS
----------------------------------------------------------------
HTML Common stuff:
Doctype declaration indicates the document type and helps browsers display web pages correctly
html tag defines the root of HTML document - contains all html tags except the doctype 
Lang attribute for SEO for html

Heading tags (1 - 6)
Good for SE 

p tags
Links - a tags href = ""
browsers will typically ignore the whitespace within the tags (javascript is a little different here)
<hr> tag will have a line and break 
<br> line break good to move sentence to next line manually

pre tag 
defines preformatted text and preserves the spaces and breaks 

Attributes - Provide additional info, name val pairs like name = "somename"
EX: 
href in anchor tags

Img's Attributes- 
src pathing can be absolute url to the http page 
Relative URL within the file pathing
width and height
alt represents an alternate text for image if cant be loaded

title attribute: Hovering over an attribute will show more detail
attributes recommended to be lowercases

styling
style="color:red;" to do styling in text can also do other stuff 
but honestly would perfer to do it all in css
always as properties:value; format
some common properties:
background-color 
color: for text 
font-family:
font-size
text-align

Common text formatting
<b> bold 
<strong> looks bolded text stronger than surrounding text  important text to Read
<i> italic
<em> empahsis text looks italic
<small> smaller text 
<mark> highlighted text 
<del> strike through the text 
<ins> underline the text has been inserted in the document 
<sub> subscript tag 
<sup> superscript tag 

Quotations
<blockquote> tag to show cited from source 
<q> for short quotation 
<abbr> abbreviates, but when hovering can see the meaning of the word
<address> pretty much the contact information of the autors and is italicized
<cite> italicied to give credit 
<bdo> bi-direcitonal override writes from left to right

Comments 
<!-- -->
Can hide multiple lines
----------------------------------------------------------------
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets 
selector (html tag){
    property: value;
}

Common properties:
text-align
color 

Kinds of selectors 
1-Css Element selectors general case on all tags 
2-Id 
instead of tags, we use id and the html tag uses the id to have css changes 
defined with #name this is typically used to select one unqiue Element
3-class based 
it is .name and used to define html elements with specific class attributes 
Can also combine class with tags 
p.center will only work on p tags with class="center" 
HTML tags can have multiple classes 
4-Universal 
* use *
----------------------------------------------------------------
JS
getElementById("demo") - JS HTML method used to fine an HTML element with the id 
Can modify contents with below example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";

Change style manually (though I doubt this would be useful)
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";

Hide elements manually
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";

Can add JS to HTML using script tags 
Can just simply do JS from an external script (I would lean towards this)
<script src="file.js"></script>

Thoughts?
I used to do webdev briefly during college. Revisiting
